# custom-objects-helm
## What is this repo?
A very simple **Helm** chart to deploy custom objects to a **Helm** deployment. Its main purpse to be used a **sub-chart** to extend existing charts.

## But why?!
Ever find it frustrating that you have a **Helm** chart deployed that just does not have what you need? You don't want to extend the actual chart? Or just deploy the **YAML** not through **Helm** value files? Well that's me... and might be you! 

There are definitly better ways to do this and several **GitHub** projects exist to do this already but I want to do for the experience.
